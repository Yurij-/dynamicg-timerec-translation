<h2>Time Recording - Translations</h2>

<!--
https://dynamicg-timerec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/timerec.apk/translations/readme.html
-->

<br>
<b>Preparation</b>
<ul>
<li>Contact developer <a href="mailto:dynamicg.android@gmail.com">dynamicg.android@gmail.com</a> so that i know which language you're doing the translation for.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<b>Setup</b>
<ol>
<li>
Install this version of Time Recording: <a href="TimeRecording-ext.apk">TimeRecording-ext.apk</a>.
This supports loading of the app's texts from the sd card.
</li>
<li>Download this file to your PC: <a href="values-en/strings.xml">strings.xml</a></li>
<li>Alternatively, use the german version as template: <a href="values-de/strings.xml">strings.xml</a></li>
<li>Translate the first few texts (e.g. "homescreenCheckinNow" and "homescreenCheckoutNow").</li>
<li>Copy the file (strings.xml) to the top level of your phone's sd card.</li>
<li>Open the app. It will load the texts from the sd card's "strings.xml" file and use within the app.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<br>
<b>Translation</b>
<ul>
<li>
Same as steps 4 to 6 above: edit the "strings.xml" file and copy the file to your SD Card.
</li>
<li>
Note on newer device (e.g. Galaxy Nexus) you can attach the phone to your PC (via USB) and open/edit the file directly from the SD Card, without blocking the app.
</li>
<li>
Whenever you close/reopen the app, the "strings.xml" file will get reloaded
</li>
<li>
When you are done with all texts, send your version of the "strings.xml" file to me so i can integrate it into the app 
(zip the file so we don't lose the file encoding when sending through email)
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<b>Rollback</b>
<br>If you want to revert to the official version of Time Recording:
<br>- either do a data backup and uninstall & reinstall the app through <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dynamicg.timerecording">Google Play Store</a>
<br>- or install the latest version from <a href="http://dynamicg-timerec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/timerec.apk/appstore">here</a>
<br>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Handling of special characters</b>

<pre>
- \n is a newline. "a\nb" will show as "a[newLine]b"
- single and double quotes have to be escaped with backslash: \' or \"
- {1} and {2} are placeholders. "Edit \'{1}\'" may become "Edit 'Tasks'"

- \u.... are utf characters:
\u2026 = ellipsis [...]
\u2192 = right arrow [-&gt;]
\u2022 = bullet

- other special characters
&amp;amp; = ampersand [&amp;] 
&amp;gt; = greater than [&gt;]
&amp;lt; = less than [&lt;]
</pre>
