<h2>Time Recording - Multi instance support</h2>

<br><b>What is "Multi instances"?</b>
<br>
The Time Recording app does not support "parallel trackers" / "multiple timers", i.e. you cannot track more than one individual within the app.
<br>
You can however install multiple instances of the app. 
Each instance runs independent and stand-alone from the others, and each instance keeps its own settings and data.
This is useful if you want to track multiple employees or a set of machinery.
<br>
In other words: you can install up to nine extra Time Recording apps on a single device.

<br>
<br><b>Notes:</b>
<br><li>These apps will show as "TR 1" through to "TR 9" in the app drawer or in the widget list
<br><li>The apps will check for version updates once a week.
<br><li>Multi instances of the "Pro" version is NOT supported.

<br>
<br><b><font color="red">Backup your SD Card regularly!</font></b>
<br>All the apps write their backup data regularly onto the sd card, to folders below <b><code>/sdcard/dynamicg</code></b>.
<br>Make sure you copy that folder to somewhere safe regularly.
<br>=&gt; Note that in case of device loss, those backups are the only means to recover data. 
If you lose your phone, without any external backup at hand, all data of all apps will be gone!
