<h2>Mark exported data</h2>

<br/>
"Mark exported data" is for advanced users. 
Use this to track and tag those work units which have been exported through one of the reports E1, E2, E3, E4 or E6.
<br/>
Tagging is done either within the &lt;&lt;Work unit notes&gt;&gt; free text field, or using the generic numeric &lt;&lt;Value 1&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;Value 2&gt;&gt; fields that are optionally available on each work unit.
<br/>
Using this in combination with the "Filters" allows to keep track of those entries which have already been reported, and those which haven't been pulled yet.
<br/>

<br/><b>Setup and invocation</b>
<br>• Tick "Mark exported data" on the report settings page (Menu / Reports / Menu / Settings)
<br>• The app will now show a "mark" icon whenever pulling one of the reports mentioned above

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/kb021/tg01.png" width="200"></td>
<td width=5></td>
<td><img src="../img/kb021/tg02.png" width="200"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br/>

<br/><b>Usage</b>
<br>• Depending on how you want to track the reported work units, enable one or more of the provided check boxes.
<br>• Note that "Value 1" and "Value 2" only allow numeric values. As a suggestion, either put in today's date in format yyyymmdd, or a simple "1" value to indicate "exported = yes".
<br>• Also keep in mind that these are the same fields as available on different screens within the app. 
E.g. setting a work unit notes text with option "Overwrite" here will overwrite all previously entered work unit notes for the reported entries.

<td width=5></td>
<td><img src="../img/kb021/tg13.png" width="200"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br/>

<br/><b>Advanced usage</b>
<br>• Note the "Filters" on the main reports page, using either the "Work unit notes filter" or (new as per version 5.15) the generic "Value 1" and "Value 2"
