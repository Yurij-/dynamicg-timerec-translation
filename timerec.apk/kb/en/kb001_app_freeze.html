<h2>Time Recording Knowlege Base</h2>

<b>The app freezes or just shows a black screen.</b>

<ul>

<li>
Check internal (phone) storage and make sure you're not running out of disk space. See "Storage" in the main Android System Settings.
Try deleting unused apps if phone storage is full.
</li>

<li>
Do a backup from within the app (Preferences page 1), then uninstall and reinstall the app.
<br>
Alternatively, update the app by installing the latest version manually. Get the APK file from 
<a href="https://dynamicg-timerec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/timerec.apk/appstore/timerecording">here</a> (for newer Android 4++ devices)
or 
<a href="https://dynamicg-timerec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/timerec.apk/appstore/timerec-legacy">here</a> (for older devices prior to Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich)
</li>

<li>
Make sure the app is *not* installed on SD Card (undo "Move to SD Card" if you have done so before).
</li>

<li>
If using the Free version: Regularly tap the "Disable Ads" button on Preferences page 1 at the bottom - we have had a few users where loading of the ads has been blocking the app.
</li>

<li>
Overall, "Pro" runs more stable than "Free" (the app file is smaller and no ads are loaded). Consider migrating to Pro.
</li>

</ul>
