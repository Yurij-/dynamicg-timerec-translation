<h2>Time Recording</h2>

<b>The app freezes or just shows a black or blank screen.</b>

(1)
If on the "Free" version: regularly tap the "Disable Ads" button on Preferences page 1 at the bottom
 - we've had a few users on Android 2 devices where loading of the ads has been blocking the app :-(
<br/>
If disabling the ads solves the issues consider upgrading to the Pro version (which doesn't show any ads)
<br/>
If this doesn't help try the next steps
<br/><br/>

(2) Check internal (phone) storage and make sure you're not running out of disk space. See "Storage" in the main Android System Settings.
Try deleting unused apps if phone storage is full.

<br/><br/>

(3)
If on the "Free" version: make sure the app is *not* installed on SD Card (undo "Move to SD Card" if you have done so before).

<br/><br/>

(4a) Do a backup from within the app (Preferences page 1), then uninstall and reinstall the app.
<br/>
(4b) Alternatively, update the app by installing the latest version manually. Get the APK file from 
<a href="https://dynamicg-timerec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/timerec.apk/appstore/timerecording">here</a> (for newer Android 4++ devices)
or 
<a href="https://dynamicg-timerec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/timerec.apk/appstore/timerec-legacy">here</a> (for older devices prior to Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich)

<br/><br/>

(5)
If step 4 fails try this:
<br>a. The app writes backups to the SD Card every day by default. Check your SD Card below <b>/sdcard/dynamicg/backup</b>, or <b>/sdcard/dynamicg/backup-pro</b> for Pro version, 
to make sure you have recent backup files (do an "order by file date" to see the latest file).
<br>b. If (a) is okay, uninstall and reinstall the app. on first start, the app will restore data and settings as per latest backup.
