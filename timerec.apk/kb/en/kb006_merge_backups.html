<h2>Time Recording</h2>

<b>Merge backup files, or merge "Archive" into live data</b>

<br/><br/>

While officially not supported there's a hidden feature to merge two or more backups into one "live" data set, or to move previously archived data back into the live data set:
<br/><br/>

1. Before proceeding do a fresh backup. Note this is very important - if subsequent steps fail you will need to roll back to this one.
<br/><br/>

2a. Go to "Preferences / Advanced / App Info" and click on the "Tweaks" text.
<br/>

2b. Click the "Copy all to archive" button.
<br/>

2c. If only restoring "Archive" into the live data set skip step 3 and continue with step 4.
<br/>

<br/>

3. For each backup file you want to merge:
<br/>• do a data restore of that backup on this device (typically: copy the "timerec.db.gz" file to the SD Card and use "Preferences / Restore / Restore backup")
<br/>• repeat steps 2a and 2b
<br/>Note: if the backup sets have overlapping entries (i.e. different entries on the same day), later "Copy all to archive" will overwrite previous entries 

<br/>

=&gt; After completion of step 3 the "Archive" contains all entries of all data backup sets. 
<br/><br/>

4. Open the "Tweaks" page from step 2a again and click "Replace Live-DB with Archive". 
<br/>=&gt; All data is now copied back into the "live" database. Go to the "Month" view and validate. 
<br/><br/>
