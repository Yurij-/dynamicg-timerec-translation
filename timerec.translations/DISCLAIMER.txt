DISCLAIMER
------------------------

==>> make sure you feel okay with these facts before starting the translation job <<==

* the free version will have advertisement (AdMob)

* i am selling the Pro version through the market, thus making money with it

* both the translated 'Free' and 'Pro' versions will be published as two new apps 
in the market. for technical reasons i cannot add the translations to the existing apps

in other words, there will be 4 versions when everything is done:
- FREE version english/german, already published
- PRO version english/german, already published
- FREE version for all the translations (it, fr, es, ...), with Ads
- PRO version for all the translations (it, fr, es, ...), no Ads

* the "aboutTranslation" text is displayed on top of the Preferences Tab 1 page.
use this field put in your credits. email and web addresses are supported.
sample - this will show a two-liner with name and email:
	Translated by DynamicG\ndaynamicg.android@gmail.com

* i cannot give out licenses for 'Pro' manually (Android Market does not 
allow that), so you will have to buy it like any normal app.
if you want, we can agree on compensation instead (for example compensation to your 
paypal account)
